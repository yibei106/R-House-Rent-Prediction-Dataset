# Housing Rental Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a housing rental dataset containing over 4,700 rows and 12 columns to determine how various factors, including family background, neighborhood, and lifestyle, influence renters' decisions. The goal is to provide insights for decision-making on house rentals based on these factors.

## Dataset

   - Transform data for better readability, simplifying entries such as tenant types, points of contact, and area types.
   - Replace abnormalities in the area locality with the mode of the area.
   - Add two new columns to indicate the number of floors in a house and the specific floor being rented.

2. **Analysis Focus**:
   - Investigate factors affecting rental decisions for bachelors vs. families.
   - Analyze seasonal trends influencing rental choices.
   - Examine the importance of BHK configuration and its impact on rental pricing.
